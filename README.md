# LN-MTS
# Project Overview

This repository contains scripts for conducting statistical analysis and enrichment analysis using R, as well as scripts for calculating 3D lymph node distance information and lymph node area information using Python.

## Directory Structure

- `R/`: Contains R scripts for statistical analysis and enrichment analysis.
- `Python/`: Contains Python scripts for 3D lymph node distance information and lymph node area calculations.

## R Scripts

### Statistical Analysis

The R scripts are designed to perform various statistical analyses on biological data. These analyses include:

- Descriptive statistics
- Hypothesis testing
- Regression analysis
- Data visualization

### Enrichment Analysis

The enrichment analysis scripts in the R directory are used to identify and interpret biological pathways and gene sets that are significantly represented in your data. This includes:

- Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment
- Pathway analysis
- Functional annotation clustering

## Python Scripts

### 3D Lymph Node Distance Calculation

The Python scripts are focused on computing the three-dimensional distances between lymph nodes. This involves:

- Parsing 3D spatial data
- Calculating Euclidean distances
- Visualizing spatial relationships

### Lymph Node Area Information

These Python scripts also calculate the area information of lymph nodes from imaging data. The process includes:

- Image processing and segmentation
- Area calculation using geometric methods
- Data aggregation and visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- R (version 4.3.1)
- Python (version 3.10.13)
